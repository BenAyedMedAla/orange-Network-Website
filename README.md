# Orange Network Website - AI Integration for Telecom Challenges

## Overview

The **Orange Network Website** is a platform built using **Vital**, **TypeScript**, and **React** that integrates AI models to address critical challenges in the telecom industry. The project focuses on utilizing AI to diagnose and resolve issues related to **eNodeB** (evolved NodeB) states, providing solutions to real-world telecom challenges.

### AI Integration

The system is designed to address two major telecom challenges:
1. **Classify Types of Anomalies in eNodeB States**: Using AI to detect and classify issues in eNodeB states, which are essential components of the telecom network.
2. **Fine-Tune a Large Language Model (LLM) to Suggest Resolutions**: Leveraging an AI-driven model to provide intelligent suggestions for resolving the identified anomalies.

### Key Highlights

- **AI-Driven Diagnostic System**: The website incorporates a complete AI system capable of diagnosing network issues.
- **Fine-Tuned BART Large Model**: A customized version of the BART Large model is used to provide faster, lower-computation responses, outperforming traditional methods in anomaly detection and resolution suggestions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection**: Automatically detects and classifies anomalies in eNodeB states using AI.
- **AI Resolution Suggestions**: Provides suggestions for resolving detected issues using a fine-tuned LLM.
- **Diagnostic Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface for monitoring anomalies and resolutions in real-time.
- **Optimized AI Model**: Utilizes a fine-tuned BART Large model for improved performance with minimal computation.

## Technologies Used

- **Vital**: The core framework used to build the platform.
- **TypeScript**: Provides strong typing and enhanced development experience for the frontend.
- **React**: Used for building the user interface and creating an interactive, dynamic experience.
- **AI Models**: 
  - **Anomaly Detection Model**: Trains and deploys AI models for detecting anomalies in eNodeB states.
  - **BART Large Model**: Fine-tuned for suggesting resolutions to anomalies based on detected patterns.
